# dbdActuatorSolver

This repository contains a custom OpenFOAM solver for simulating **Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) actuators**. The solver is designed to model the electrohydrodynamic effects in fluid flow generated by plasma discharges, commonly used for flow control and propulsion applications.

### **Status: Repository Under Update**

Please note that this repository is currently being updated. We are working on enhancing the solver and adding new features, test cases, and documentation. During this update phase, some functionality may be subject to change, and there could be occasional disruptions.

### **What’s Being Updated?**

- **Solver Improvements**: Optimizations and enhancements to the core solver for better performance and accuracy.
- **New Test Cases**: Adding new test cases to showcase the solver’s capabilities and ensure its robustness in various scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Ongoing updates to the documentation to improve clarity and provide more detailed explanations of the solver’s usage and configuration.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing known issues and implementing fixes to ensure the solver runs smoothly.

### **Installation**

Instructions on how to install the solver will be updated soon as the repository stabilizes.

### **Usage**

Further details on how to use the solver and test cases will be added as updates are completed.
