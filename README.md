# dbdActuatorSolver

This repository contains a custom OpenFOAM solver for simulating **Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) actuators**. The solver is designed to model the electrohydrodynamic effects in fluid flow generated by plasma discharges, commonly used for flow control and propulsion applications.

### **Status: Repository Under Update**

Please note that this repository is currently being updated. We are working on enhancing the solver and adding new features, test cases, and documentation. During this update phase, some functionality may be subject to change, and there could be occasional disruptions.

### **What’s Being Updated?**

- **Solver Improvements**: Optimizations and enhancements to the core solver for better performance and accuracy.
- **New Test Cases**: Adding new test cases to showcase the solver’s capabilities and ensure its robustness in various scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Ongoing updates to the documentation to improve clarity and provide more detailed explanations of the solver’s usage and configuration.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressing known issues and implementing fixes to ensure the solver runs smoothly.

### **Installation**

Instructions on how to install the solver will be updated soon as the repository stabilizes.

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dbdActuatorSolver.git

# Navigate to the OpenFOAM installation directory
$ cd $FOAM_USER_APPBIN

# Copy the solvers into your application folder
$ cp -r /path/to/dbdActuatorSolver/solvers .

# Rebuild OpenFOAM (optional)
$ wmake
```


### **Usage**

#### Workflow

1. **multiRegionSuzenEHD Solver**:

   * Run the `multiRegionSuzenEHD` solver to compute the EHD force field (`ehdForce`).
   * The solver outputs the EHD force field, which is used as a source term in the momentum equation.

2. **dbdFlowSimple Solver**:

   * Run the `dbdFlowSimple` solver with the `ehdForce` as an input field to simulate the flow dynamics under the influence of the electrohydrodynamic forces.

#### Example Run

```bash
# Step 1: Run the multiRegionSuzenEHD solver
$ multiRegionSuzenEHD

# Step 2: Run the dbdFlowSimple solver
$ dbdFlowSimple
```

Ensure that the appropriate fields (velocity, pressure, and EHD force) are correctly defined in your case setup.
